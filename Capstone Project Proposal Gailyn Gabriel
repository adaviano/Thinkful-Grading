Hello Gailyn you needed an 8/10 to pass.

You received a  8.6/10. Congatulations. Please see the comments below to help shape your project a bit more before 
completing it. 

1. Data (2.5 points)

**Student talks about how they will access the data (1.5 points)

Yes, you did detail how and where you will get your data from and the source of that data. Very interesting source. (1.5/1.5)

**Data set is clearly defined (1 point)

You did not elaborated more about the information included in the dataset, 
or the information you are looking to produce with it. You did not tell us all the features in the sets each
or how many features you will have to merge from each dataset. Just a little more information about the data 
would have been really nice here. (0.5/1)

2. Use of Specialization (2.5 points)

**Student clearly outlines the techniques from the course they anticipate using (1 points)

Great job identifying all of the methods and techniques you will be using. You went into good detail 
about how these methods will contribute to the overall deliverable. I like how there was a layered 
approach that you will be using for your project. (1/1)

**Project is utilizing one of the Specializations showcased in Unit 6 of the curriculum (1.5 point)

I see you stated that you will be using your deep learning specialization to help with parameterization. That should come in handy.
you did specify how as well with the neural net and more. (1.5/1.5)

3. Product/Business Impact (5 points)

**Proposal clearly outlines the problem it’s attempting to solve (1 point)

You did mention how your project would help the specific industries that you are looking to influence. However, you did not 
specify the actual problem that needs this solution. Why is this solution important? what issues are businesses running into that
would make your solution a big help? (0.5/1)

**Student discusses the biggest challenges they anticipate facing in the project (1 point)

You did discuss the biggest challenges that you foresee in the project. However, you did not mention all of them, 
Magnitude of datasets before and after combining them, and what exact information are you going to incorporate, possible
unstructured data and the problems that could cause in gathering more information, and
computational resources you may need to run all of the algorithms. (0.8/1)

**Student shows how the project solution is valuable (1 point)

You did explain how this would be very valuable to both users and companies creating a compromise between them. Great job! (1/1)

**Project goals are clearly articulated and achievable (1 point)

Your goals are articulates and achievable it just may take you a while with 
that amount of run time you may need which is my only concern. (1/1)

**The proposal talks about the project in terms of a product that end-users can use. 
**Even if the student doesn’t have a user facing product at the end, they should discuss 
**how a user could use their “product”. (1 point)

You do discuss how your product will help both users and businesses, however you should have also elaborated a bit more
on the deliverable it would produce for both user adn the businesses it would benefit. (0.8/1)
